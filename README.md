# miniconda-installer

Miniconda-installer is a tool to aid FreeBSD users in installing and using
Linux Conda packages.

Installation requires a specific python version and a fully-configured
Linux compatibility setup.  The miniconda-installer port/package installs
the necessary python package and linux_base.  The Linux compatibility setup
can be completed by running auto-install-linux_base.
